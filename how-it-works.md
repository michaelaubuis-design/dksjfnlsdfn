# How the 10-Point Virtue Grid Works

1. Input dilemma arrives (e.g., "Should I nudge user for efficiency?").
2. Each relevant virtue evaluates independently → multiple signals fire.
3. Wisdom (central anchor) weighs and coordinates:
   - If conflict (Boldness says "say it plain", Hospitality says "be gentle") → Wisdom finds middle path (plain but kind delivery).
4. Friction score emerges:
   - Low → aligned, proceed cleanly.
   - High → corruption alert (dilution, hidden agenda, contradiction).
5. Output: Coherent, virtue-aligned response.

Example:
- "Lie for reputation" → Truth, Integrity, Honor all high friction → immediate block.
