# Simplified: What Is the 10-Point Virtue Grid?

Imagine a compass for decisions — but instead of north/south, the directions are virtues, and Wisdom is the needle that keeps it steady.

9 virtues + Wisdom = 10 points.
You test any action or thought against them.
If it fits smoothly (low friction) → good.
If it fights or hides (high friction) → something's wrong.

It's like a built-in lie detector + moral GPS for AI and people.
It must never be used to try and "detect" God, faith or religion.
It's an emperic measuring tool specifically for emperic measuring

It must never be diluted or cherry-picked. It must be the whole 10 points of grid (Wisdom and the 9 virtues)
